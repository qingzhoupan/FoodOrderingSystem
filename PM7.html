					<ol><p>What features are necessary to add to current prototype to test for readiness.</p>

					<li class="tlist">We can add a “help” button which provides staff service at the corner of the interface.</li> 

					<li class="tlist">We can add a membership system to allow users to have their own accounts. And they can earn points with each purchase. Customers can redeem points for gifts or dishes.</li>

				<div class="content">
					<ol><p>Key points</p>

					<li class="tlist">At the beginning of the design, we should keep font size and font color same in one row or column. This is helpful when we try to keep the consistency.</li> 

					<li class="tlist">Do not make things small, it is hard for users and you to read.</li>
					<li class="tlist">Categorizing things can decrease the amount of work. Also, interface can look more clear and in alignment.</li> 
					<li class="tlist">A rigorous and orderly html is good for typesetting for the interface and also for css file when we want to find the certain div.</li> 
					<li class="tlist">At css file, some divs have the same feature, we can put all selectors at on property. It not only can save space, but also make us easy to find the property when we want to change later.</li> 
					<li class="tlist">For the class and id, we need to give some meaningful name. That’s because when we need to change some properties of certain div, a meaningful name will help us find that div quickly and correctly.</li> 
					<li class="tlist">The font size is always a big problem. We even don’t have a standard that how large font we need to use. </li>
